# Preprocessing-Financial-Data
This repository contains all project materials to analysis the company's financial data using a unprocessed dataset. Our main goal is to analyze the Financial data and provide valuable insights using the dataset. However, there are things that are needed to be done first. Please view the project guideline for more information!

## Introduction
If you are new to this Repository, we have one main file that contains the main project coding `Project-Code.ipynb`, within this code you should be able to understand further about the data and how to preprocess the data. This project is completed using Microsoft Visual Studio with Python 3.12, if you are using a lower version of Python you might encounter issues that is not included in this project. The data is originally obtained from Kaggle.com, data author [Atharva Arya](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaarya25) and [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaarya25/financials). Feel free to explore more analysis beyond this report!
